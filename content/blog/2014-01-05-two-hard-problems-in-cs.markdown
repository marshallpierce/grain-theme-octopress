The adage is that there are two hard problems in computer science: caching, naming things, and off-by-one errors. In this post, I'm going to talk about the first two.

# Caching




# Naming things

If you're not a Linux/Unix user, this blog's name will make no sense. Sorry 'bout that. The `/var/log` directory is historically where log files have gone on Unix-y systems, and 'blog' is kind of like 'log', and I thought it was funny when I registered this domain years ago. Cool story, right?
